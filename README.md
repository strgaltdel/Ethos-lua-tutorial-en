# **Welcome!**

</br></br>

This is a tutorial to help you get started with using the Lua programming language under Ethos.
(It is definitely not a tutorial for learning the Lua programming language itself. There are already plenty of sites for that; see the tutorial section "Further Information Sources")

The tutorial will be gradually expanded chapter by chapter.

</br>

It started in August 2024 with Chapter 1, "General Introduction," and is available here as a Wiki (thanks to Lothar Thole for asstistance):

https://github.com/strgaltdel/Ethos-lua-tutorial-en/wiki

</br></br>

as well as an german version here:

https://github.com/strgaltdel/Ethos-lua-tutorial-de/wiki

</br>

The repository contains the tutorial as a PDF under "docs."
Example Lua scripts will also be stored in the repository.

It is planned to release a new chapter every 6-8 weeks.

Participants of the German FrSky Forum by Engel can also access it in the Wiki there.

**I hope this helps you get up to speed with Ethos Lua more quickly!**
